[CIS25] Assignment #13
Program to calculate the average temperature of numbers within an array.
Uses the method of letting the user type how many temperatures they want to input (let's say 5 temperatures).
The numbers are then stored into an array using a for loop and displayed individually one by one (such as {50, 69, 90, 85, 75}.
Then, the program calculates the average of the numbers in the array using the formula "average = sum/(array)".
